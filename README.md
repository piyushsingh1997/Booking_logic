Imagine an simple logic or an app that helps you count the number of people enter. You start with zero, and every time someone enters, you just click a button to increase the count. Once you're done counting, you can press another button to save that count as a record("previous entry") and the count goes back to zero for the next round of counting.  It's like a very simple handy tool logic for keeping track of how many people come and go.
